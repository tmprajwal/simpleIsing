<H2><u>Brief Introduction</u></H2>
<p> Ising model was developed by Ising in 1924 as a part of his doctoral thesis. Of course 1D was worked out first before
Lars Onsager solved the 2D Ising model analytically in 1944. While the 1D Ising model has no phase transitions, 2D has one
phase transition and it is interesting to study the properties such as heat capacity and magnetization of the lattice at
 the critical temperature (<i>T<sub>c</sub></i>). In this project, heat capacity and magnetization of <i>3</i> different
lattice geometries were studied. All the latices presented here have homomorphic lattice points, i.e. all the lattice 
points are equivivalent, therefore continuous boundaries were used (the lattice resembles a surface on a sphere).

Also, effects of block spin tranformation and correlation functions in a square lattice are presented here.

<H2><u>Method</u></H2>
In an Ising model the Metropolis algorithm may be used. A random lattice point is picked and if changing its spin reduces the total energy of the lattice, then
the spin is slipped or if flipping the spin increases the energy of the lattice, then we may still flip the spin but with a
probability given by the Maxwell Boltzmann distribution (<i>e<sup>-<sup>E</sup>/<sub>kT</sub></sup></i>) where <i>E</i> is
the difference in lattice energy if the spin was flipped and <i>T</i> is the temperature of the system. This work inolves 
only 2 spin systems in which the spins can only be +1/-1 (up/down). Here, we have used (<i>n X n : 20 X 20</i>) lattices with about
<i>n<sup>6</sup></i> spin flip trials for each temperature that the code was run for. For correlation function and effects 
of block spin transformation, a larger lattice with sizes of about <i>100 X 100</i> and <i>90 X 90</i> were used,
 respectively.

<H2><u>Results and Discussion</u></H2>
<p><ul>
<li><H5>Heat Capacity</H5>
To calculate the heat capacity, total energy for the lattice was calculated and the standard therodynamic definition of 
<i>C<sub>v</sub></i> was used to compute the value of the head capacity.

<ul>
<li>Square Lattice: <img src = plot1.png>
<li>Trangular Lattice: <img src = plot2.png>
<li>Moore Lattice: <img src = plot3.png>
</ul>

The graphs above indicate a phase transition for each lattice at a specific temperature where the value of heat capacity 
diverges.

<ul>
<li>Square Lattice: <i>T<sub>c</sub> = 2.2K</i>
<li>Trangular Lattice: <i>T<sub>c</sub> = 3.9K</i>
<li>Moore Lattice: <i>T<sub>c</sub> = 5.5K</i>
</ul>

<li><H5>Magnetizaton</H5>
Magetization was easily computed by adding together all the spins of thelattice points for every temperature.
As seen below, the magnetization is almost 100% below the critical point and then drops off and becomes completely random
beyond the critical temperature. This ratifies the existence of a critical phenomena at those temperatures.

<li>Trangular Lattice: <img src = plot5.png>
<li>Moore Lattice: <img src = plot6.png>
</ul>

<li><H5>Correlation Function</H5>
Plots of correlation function indicate how far some particular structure streaches on the lattice. The idea of 'structure'
becomes evident with the following illustration. Below are <i>2</i> cases, one in which the <i>T<sub>c</sub> = .1K</i> 
followed by <i>T<sub>c</sub> = 10K</i>. We of course start off with a randomized lattice.</p>

<pre> <i>T<sub>c</sub> = 10K</i>
Initial: <img src = plot10.png>, Final: <img src = plot10b.png>
<i>T<sub>c</sub> = .10K</i>
Initial: <img src = plot9.png>, Final: <img src = plot9b.png>
</pre>

<p>    
In the high temperature case, the spins are all random but in the low temperature case we see clustering of similar spins 
(which is the structure here). Correlation function given by, <img src = eq2.png>, can be used to calculate the 
correlation length (the distance over which the correlation fucntion falls off by a factor of <b>e</b>). Sub- 
critical lattices will have very high correlation length, i.e. the correlation function will remain almost constant, but
in a lattice which is over the critical temperature, the correlation length is much smaller, i.e. the value of correlation 
function falls off, with distance, very soon owing to the randomness of the system. The plot below shows the correlation
function plotted against distance for temperatures spanning [<i>1,2,3,...,10</i>]K (1K is the topmost line and 10K the 
lowest one).</p><p>

To show that scale doesn't affect this system, one can apply the block spin transformation which is also a powerful 
technique to investigate system near critical temperature. Below is a plot of magnetization for (<i>90 X 90</i>) and 
for a lattice on which a block spin transformation was applied effectively making it the size of (<i>30 X 30</i>). As shall be
seen, only the scales have changed. The location of the critical phenomena does not change. The elbow in magnetization curve
still occurs at the critical temperature.</p><p>

A movie of the simulation can be seen in the mathematica file <a href = ising.nb>ising.nb</a>. Here a square 
(<i>50 X 50</i>) lattice is used and the temperature can be set to an appropriate value.
